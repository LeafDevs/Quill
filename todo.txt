Fix Tool calls
Cargo Check and fix errors
add the other tool calls
do ALOT of debugging and prompt tweaking
Implement reasoning model support (currently none)


Maybe add other provider support like openai, gemini, anthropic and even openrouter
Maybe even add a backend server to make this a paid 20$ a month or 30$ a month for access to 500 requests a month for premium models from other providers

find beta testers/people who want to test this and give me feedback cuz why not it might be very good, or it might not :P.
